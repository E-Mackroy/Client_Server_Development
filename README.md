Dashboard

For this course, I submitted my final dashboard code and README file from Project Two. The main goal was to create a working dashboard that connects to a live MongoDB database using my own CRUD Python module. This project helped me understand how to build programs that are not only functional but also easy to maintain, read, and adapt. When I wrote the CRUD module, I kept the functions simple and clear so they could be reused later without major changes. The same module from Project One connects the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. Writing modular code like this made the second project much easier to complete because I didn’t have to rewrite the database logic. It also keeps things more organized since the dashboard only handles the visual side, while the CRUD module manages all the data calls. I can easily see myself using this same setup for future projects that need to read or display data from a database.

When I approach a problem as a computer science student, I start by breaking it into smaller steps. For this project, that meant first understanding what Grazioso Salvare needed, then deciding how the database and dashboard should interact. I focused on getting the data to display correctly before worrying about design. Once the filters and data connection worked, I added the charts, map, and layout features. Working this way keeps the process manageable and makes it easier to spot issues early. My experience from earlier courses helped a lot because I already had practice working with Python, data structures, and JSON formatting. I also used what I learned about user interfaces and data visualization to make sure the dashboard was clean, easy to read, and looked professional. In future projects, I plan to keep improving this approach by designing flexible systems that can scale and be updated without needing a full rebuild.

Computer scientists solve real-world problems by finding better ways to manage and interpret data. This project is a great example of that. By creating an interactive dashboard, I made it easier for a company like Grazioso Salvare to find the right animals for their rescue missions. Instead of manually going through records, they can filter data by rescue type and instantly see which animals fit the criteria. That kind of efficiency makes their work faster and more reliable, which can make a real difference when it comes to saving lives or responding to emergencies. Working on this taught me how valuable data organization and visualization are, not just for businesses but for anyone trying to make decisions based on information. It showed me that programming isn’t just about writing code—it’s about creating tools that make work easier and more meaningful for others.
